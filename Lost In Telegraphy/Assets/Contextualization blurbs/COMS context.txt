In 1995, with the onset of commercialization and privatization of what was then only starting to be called 'The Internet', an accordance was signed between all major nation users of the technology. The agreement prohibited mass profit gain from the democratically originated web, and kept it in the hands of institutions, the military, and a few small fan pockets. As a result, The Internet never flourished among personal and widespread use. Progress kept advancing of course, and mass communication methods were sorely needed. And thus, the electric telegraph returned triumphantly to common use alongside boxy analog computers.In the game Lost In Telegraphy, you play a telegraph booth officer receiving, copying, and transmitting messages along. As an agent of communication, your job is to preserve a message's meaning, even if it may not fit the original sender's exact words. Use your own judgement, history, biases, and common sense to decide how you may want to copy an incoming telegraph.Before, during, and after playing, try to think of how your power in the game might mirror someone in our world, and in our time. Lost In Telegraphy has no consequences for an 'incorrectly' recopied message, and your own personal morals are your guide. How might this parallel someone or something working in a transmission or representation position in our Internet-infused life?Above all, enjoy Lost In Telegraphy!
